    "Reflection:\n",
    "Taking the computer science courses at Del Norte prepares you for many college and professional experiences. Colleges may have a lottery system for computer science majors, so submitting a lot of applications improves your chances. Having (coding) extracurriculars is good especially those related to teaching since in order to teach you need to have an understanding on a deeper level. Building projects is very important to demonstrate your skills rather than just stating your proficiency. Computer science has many facets and is a very difficult major, but with enough extracurricular and in-school work gaining experience becomes much easier."
