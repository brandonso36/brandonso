    "25. In the following procedure, the parameter n is an integer greater than 2. Which of the following best describes the value returned by the procedure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: The procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: Upon further inspection this makes sense since j inceases by 1 each time and is added to result meaning that it adds by 1, 2, 3 and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of public key encryption in transmitting messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: Public key encryption enables parties to initiate secure communications through an open medium, such as the Internet, in which there might be eavesdroppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: I didn't know that much about public key encyption but now I know that it establishes secure connection between people communicating online.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. Which of the following best explains how symmetric encryption algorithms are typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: Symmetric encryption uses a single key that should be kept secret. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: I thought that symmetric meant there would be 2 keys but it makes sense how symmetric means the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. A code segment is intended to transform the list utensils so that the last element of the list is moved to the beginning of the list. Which of the following code segments transforms the list as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "len = LENGTH(utensils)\n",
    "temp = utensils[len]\n",
    "REMOVE(utensils, len)\n",
    "INSERT(utensils, 1, temp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: This makes sense since len becomes the length of the list and temp therefore becomes the last element of the list. Then the last element is removed and then inserted at the beginning of the list using temp.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. The following code segment is intended to remove all duplicate elements in the list myList. The procedure does not work as intended. For which of the following contents of myList will the procedure NOT produce the intended results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: \n",
    "[10, 10, 20, 20, 10, 10], [30, 50, 40, 10, 20, 40]\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: The code only checks if the element adjacent is a duplicate and when simplified the first list becomes [10. 20, 10] and the second list becomes [30, 50, 40, 10, 20, 40] which still contain duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. A programmer wants to create a new string by removing the character in position n of the string oldStr. For example, if oldStr is \"best\" and n is 3, then the new string should be \"bet\". Assume that 1 < n < len(oldStr). Which of the following code segments can be used to create the desired new string and store it in newStr?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer:\n",
    "left = substring(oldStr, 1, n - 1)\n",
    "right = substring(oldStr, n + 1, len(oldStr))\n",
    "newStr = concat(left, right)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "newStr = substring(oldStr, 1, n - 1)\n",
    "newStr = concat(newStr, substring(oldStr, n + 1, len(oldStr)))\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection: The first code segment works by creatin a left and right segment of the word besides the n letter and then combines it. The second code segment works in a similar manner, but combines the right segment with the combining step."
