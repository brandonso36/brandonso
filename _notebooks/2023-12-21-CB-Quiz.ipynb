    "4. In a certain computer program, two positive integers are added together, resulting in an overflow error. Which of the following best explains why the error occurs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The program can only use a fixed number of bits to represent integers; the computed sum is greater than the maximum representable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense since computers can only represent a certain number of bits. If the sum is greater than the maximum representable value, then it will overflow.\n",

    "14. Which of the following can be used as step 3 so that the algorithm works as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Step 3: Display the remainder of number divided by 10 and store the integer quotient in number\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense since you need to store the number not the remainder.\n",
